<h2>...What.....!?</h2>
<br>
<p>MathsMinds.com is an online learning platform. It helps students who score low marks in math. 
  They can freely access Livebooks, Quizzes, and text, and they also receive mentoring support, all provided in Telugu language.
  By offering resources and mentoring in Telugu, we give those who prefer their native language a chance to learn math effectively and improve their math skills. 
  This inclusive approach aims to make learning more effective.

<h2>...Why...!?</h2>
<br>
<p>In India, many students struggle with math due to poor teaching. To solve this, I am creating MathsMinds.com, an online platform offering high-quality education for 10th-grade Telugu medium students. We provide top-notch online classes and interactive multiple-choice questions to improve learning and boost academic performance. Our goal is to give students a strong foundation for a successful future.</p>

<br>
<p>Students can access math tutorials on the platform without any login requirements. They can freely explore Livebooks, Quizzes, and tests, and receive mentoring support in Telugu. If students want to get a certificate, they need to register on the platform.
